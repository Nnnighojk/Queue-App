# Queue-App
Contains all three app interface code - user, handler, admin


This is all the code for the quick queue app. Front end languages were JavaScript, CSS, HTML and backend was PHP.

The app has three interfaces:
1) User
2) Handler
3) Admin

The user can get into a queue before hand via his GPS location or by adding the queue location manually. It will display 
the wait time and will alert the user five minutes before his turn.

The handler checks in all the users and verifies if the right user has arrived.

The admin adds a queue at a location and an approximate of the wait time of the queue.
